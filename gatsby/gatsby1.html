		The Great Gatsby Chapter 1
	</h1>
	<h2>
		Summary:
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The narrator is Nick Carraway</li>
		<li>Nick is an unbiased narrator, as his father told him to withhold judgments as a child</li>
		<li>He recently exited World War I, and also graduated from Yale</li>
		<li>Nick decided to go to New York City, to learn and enter the bond business</li>
		<li>It is the start of the summer of 1922, and Nick lives in a section of Long Island known as West Egg</li>
		<li>West Egg is full of "new money," filled of people who recently achieved high wealth</li>
		<li>In contrast, East Egg is full of the "old money," having people born into wealthy aristocratic families</li>
		<li>Nick heads to East Egg for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband Tom Buchanan, an old college friend of Nick</li>
			<ul>
				<li>The Buchanan's are "enormously wealthy" (inherited wealth since they live in East Egg), and live in a huge house</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Tom is a highly aggressive man, and a former football player. (I'm sure there's no correlation between the two)</li>
		<li>Daisy is chatting with her friend Jordan Baker, both dressed in white</li>
		<li>Jordan brings up the name "Gatsby," to which Daisy shows curiosity</li>
		<li>During dinner, Tom brings up a recent book he has read: "Rise of the Colored Empires." He feels the white man has to be careful, in order keep his superior place in society. Nice.</li>
		<li>Unexpectedly, Tom gets a phone call in the middle of dinner, and goes to answer it. Daisy conceals what she's feeling, and leaves the table.</li>
		<li>Nick attempts some idle conversation with Jordan, but she shushes him. Jordan explains how Tom is having an affair with a woman in New York, and how "she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time"</li>
		<li>Tom and Daisy return to the table, and things are a bit tense for the rest of the night as the group dissolves</li>
		<li>Daisy and Nick talk for a bit, and Daisy says how when her daughter was born, she hoped that she'd grow up to be a "beautiful little fool." (This helps show gender roles in the 1920s)</li>
		<li>Nick then learns that Jordon is a golfer. This sounds familiar to him, but he can't remember why.</li>
		<li>Nick returns home, and sees the silhouette of Mr. Gatsby on the lawn reaching out at a green light across the lake. (More on that in the "Deeper Meaning" section.)</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
			The first thing that Nick explains, is how his father told him as a child "whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." This is telling the reader that Nick is impartial - he won't hold much judgment on the actions of others.
